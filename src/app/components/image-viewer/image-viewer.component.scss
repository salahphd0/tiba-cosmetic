// USAGE
// ::ng-deep, >>> and /deep/ disable view encapsulation for specific CSS rules, in other words, it gives you access to DOM elements, which are not in your component's HTML. For example, if you're using Angular Material (or any other third-party library like this), some generated elements are outside of your component's area (such as dialog) and you can't access those elements directly or using a regular CSS way. If you want to change the styles of those elements, you can use one of those three things, for example:

:host {
  .mainContainer {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 10000;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    top: 0;
    display: flex;
    justify-items: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: #00000055;
    backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
    transition: all 0.5s;
  }
  ion-slides {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
  ion-slide {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    min-height: 400px;
  }
  img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
}
